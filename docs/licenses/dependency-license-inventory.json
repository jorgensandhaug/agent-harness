The `bun-types` package lives in the Bun repo under `packages/bun-types`.\n\nTo add a new file, add it under `packages/bun-types`. Then add a [triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) pointing to it inside [./index.d.ts](./index.d.ts).\n\n```diff\n+ /// <reference path=\"./newfile.d.ts\" />\n```\n\n```bash\nbun build\n```"

    "licenseText": "# Commander.js\n\n  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).\n\n [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install commander\n\n## Option parsing\n\n Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('commander');\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')\n  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')\n  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')\n  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('you ordered a pizza with:');\nif (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineappe');\nif (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');\nconsole.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineappe\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split('..').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .usage('[options] <file ...>')\n  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)\n  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)\n  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)\n  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)\n  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(' int: %j', program.integer);\nconsole.log(' float: %j', program.float);\nconsole.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(' list: %j', program.list);\nconsole.log(' args: %j', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for \"--help\". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable \"stuff\" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('../');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')\n  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')\n  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node's emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on('--help', function(){\n  console.log('  Examples:');\n  console.log('');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');\n  console.log('');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('stuff');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .prompt(msg, fn)\n\n Single-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('name: ', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Multi-line prompt:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('description:', function(name){\n  console.log('hi %s', name);\n});\n```\n\n Coercion:\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Age: ', Number, function(age){\n  console.log('age: %j', age);\n});\n```\n\n```js\nprogram.prompt('Birthdate: ', Date, function(date){\n  console.log('date: %s', date);\n});\n```\n\n## .password(msg[, mask], fn)\n\nPrompt for password without echoing:\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\nPrompt for password with mask char \"*\":\n\n```js\nprogram.password('Password: ', '*', function(pass){\n  console.log('got \"%s\"', pass);\n  process.stdin.destroy();\n});\n```\n\n## .confirm(msg, fn)\n\n Confirm with the given `msg`:\n\n```js\nprogram.confirm('continue? ', function(ok){\n  console.log(' got %j', ok);\n});\n```\n\n## .choose(list, fn)\n\n Let the user choose from a `list`:\n\n```js\nvar list = ['tobi', 'loki', 'jane', 'manny', 'luna'];\n\nconsole.log('Choose the coolest pet:');\nprogram.choose(list, function(i){\n  console.log('you chose %d \"%s\"', i, list[i]);\n});\n```\n\n## Links\n\n - [API documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/)\n - [ascii tables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/cli-table)\n - [progress bars](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress)\n - [more progress bars](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter)\n - [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/tree/master/examples)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

    "licenseText": "# Commander.js\n\n  The complete solution for [node.js](http://nodejs.org) command-line interfaces, inspired by Ruby's [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander).\n\n [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/visionmedia/commander.js)\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install commander\n\n## Option parsing\n\n Options with commander are defined with the `.option()` method, also serving as documentation for the options. The example below parses args and options from `process.argv`, leaving remaining args as the `program.args` array which were not consumed by options.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('commander');\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-p, --peppers', 'Add peppers')\n  .option('-P, --pineapple', 'Add pineapple')\n  .option('-b, --bbq', 'Add bbq sauce')\n  .option('-c, --cheese [type]', 'Add the specified type of cheese [marble]', 'marble')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('you ordered a pizza with:');\nif (program.peppers) console.log('  - peppers');\nif (program.pineapple) console.log('  - pineapple');\nif (program.bbq) console.log('  - bbq');\nconsole.log('  - %s cheese', program.cheese);\n```\n\n Short flags may be passed as a single arg, for example `-abc` is equivalent to `-a -b -c`. Multi-word options such as \"--template-engine\" are camel-cased, becoming `program.templateEngine` etc.\n\n## Automated --help\n\n The help information is auto-generated based on the information commander already knows about your program, so the following `--help` info is for free:\n\n```  \n $ ./examples/pizza --help\n\n   Usage: pizza [options]\n\n   Options:\n\n     -V, --version        output the version number\n     -p, --peppers        Add peppers\n     -P, --pineapple      Add pineapple\n     -b, --bbq            Add bbq sauce\n     -c, --cheese <type>  Add the specified type of cheese [marble]\n     -h, --help           output usage information\n\n```\n\n## Coercion\n\n```js\nfunction range(val) {\n  return val.split('..').map(Number);\n}\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',');\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .usage('[options] <file ...>')\n  .option('-i, --integer <n>', 'An integer argument', parseInt)\n  .option('-f, --float <n>', 'A float argument', parseFloat)\n  .option('-r, --range <a>..<b>', 'A range', range)\n  .option('-l, --list <items>', 'A list', list)\n  .option('-o, --optional [value]', 'An optional value')\n  .parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log(' int: %j', program.integer);\nconsole.log(' float: %j', program.float);\nconsole.log(' optional: %j', program.optional);\nprogram.range = program.range || [];\nconsole.log(' range: %j..%j', program.range[0], program.range[1]);\nconsole.log(' list: %j', program.list);\nconsole.log(' args: %j', program.args);\n```\n\n## Custom help\n\n You can display arbitrary `-h, --help` information\n by listening for \"--help\". Commander will automatically\n exit once you are done so that the remainder of your program\n does not execute causing undesired behaviours, for example\n in the following executable \"stuff\" will not output when\n `--help` is used.\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\n/**\n * Module dependencies.\n */\n\nvar program = require('../');\n\nfunction list(val) {\n  return val.split(',').map(Number);\n}\n\nprogram\n  .version('0.0.1')\n  .option('-f, --foo', 'enable some foo')\n  .option('-b, --bar', 'enable some bar')\n  .option('-B, --baz', 'enable some baz');\n\n// must be before .parse() since\n// node's emit() is immediate\n\nprogram.on('--help', function(){\n  console.log('  Examples:');\n  console.log('');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help --help');\n  console.log('    $ custom-help -h');\n  console.log('');\n});\n\nprogram.parse(process.argv);\n\nconsole.log('stuff');\n```\n\nyielding the following help output:\n\n```\n\nUsage: custom-help [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -V, --version  output the version number\n  -f, --foo      enable some foo\n  -b, --bar      enable some bar\n  -B, --baz      enable some baz\n\nExamples:\n\n  $ custom-help --help\n  $ custom-help -h\n\n```\n\n## .outputHelp()\n\n  Output help information without exiting.\n\n## .help()\n\n  Output help information and exit immediately.\n\n## Links\n\n - [API documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/commander.js/)\n - [ascii tables](https://github.com/LearnBoost/cli-table)\n - [progress bars](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-progress)\n - [more progress bars](https://github.com/substack/node-multimeter)\n - [examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js/tree/master/examples)\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

    "licenseText": "# Dox\n\n Dox is a JavaScript documentation generator written with [node](http://nodejs.org). Dox no longer generates an opinionated structure or style for your docs, it simply gives you a JSON representation, allowing you to use _markdown_ and _JSDoc_-style tags.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from npm:\n\n    $ npm install -g dox\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n`dox(1)` operates over stdio:\n\n    $ dox < utils.js\n    ...JSON... \n\n to inspect the generated data you can use the `--debug` flag, which is easier to read than the JSON output:\n \n     $ dox --debug < utils.js \n\nutils.js:\n\n```js\n/**\n * Escape the given `html`.\n *\n * Examples:\n *\n *     utils.escape('<script></script>')\n *     // => '&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'\n *\n * @param {String} html string to be escaped\n * @return {String} escaped html\n * @api public\n */\n\nexports.escape = function(html){\n  return String(html)\n    .replace(/&(?!\\w+;)/g, '&amp;')\n    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')\n    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;');\n};\n```\n\noutput:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"tags\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"param\",\n        \"types\": [\n          \"String\"\n        ],\n        \"name\": \"html\",\n        \"description\": \"string to be escaped\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"return\",\n        \"types\": [\n          \"String\"\n        ],\n        \"description\": \"escaped html\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"api\",\n        \"visibility\": \"public\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"description\": {\n      \"full\": \"<p>Escape the given <code>html</code>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Examples</h2>\\n\\n<pre><code>utils.escape('&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;')\\n// =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;'\\n</code></pre>\",\n      \"summary\": \"<p>Escape the given <code>html</code>.</p>\",\n      \"body\": \"<h2>Examples</h2>\\n\\n<pre><code>utils.escape('&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;')\\n// =&amp;gt; '&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;'\\n</code></pre>\"\n    },\n    \"isPrivate\": false,\n    \"ignore\": false,\n    \"code\": \"exports.escape = function(html){\\n  return String(html)\\n    .replace(/&(?!\\\\w+;)/g, '&amp;')\\n    .replace(/</g, '&lt;')\\n    .replace(/>/g, '&gt;');\\n};\",\n    \"ctx\": {\n      \"type\": \"method\",\n      \"receiver\": \"exports\",\n      \"name\": \"escape\",\n      \"string\": \"exports.escape()\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis output can then be passed to a template for rendering. Look below at the \"Properties\" section for details.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n\nUsage: dox [options]\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help     output usage information\n  -v, --version  output the version number\n  -d, --debug    output parsed comments for debugging\n\nExamples:\n\n  # stdin\n  $ dox > myfile.json\n\n  # operates over stdio\n  $ dox < myfile.js > myfile.json\n\n```\n\n## Properties\n\n  A \"comment\" is comprised of the following detailed properties:\n  \n    - tags\n    - description\n    - isPrivate\n    - ignore\n    - code\n    - ctx\n\n### Description\n\n  A dox description is comprised of three parts, the \"full\" description,\n  the \"summary\", and the \"body\". The following example has only a \"summary\",\n  as it consists of a single paragraph only, therefore the \"full\" property has\n  only this value as well.\n\n```js\n/**\n * Output the given `str` to _stdout_.\n */\n\nexports.write = function(str) {\n  process.stdout.write(str);\n};\n````\nyields:\n\n```js\ndescription: \n     { full: '<p>Output the given <code>str</code> to <em>stdout</em>.</p>',\n       summary: '<p>Output the given <code>str</code> to <em>stdout</em>.</p>',\n       body: '' },\n```\n\n  Large descriptions might look something like the following, where the \"summary\" is still the first paragraph, the remaining description becomes the \"body\". Keep in mind this _is_ markdown, so you can indent code, use lists, links, etc. Dox also augments markdown, allowing \"Some Title:\\n\" to form a header.\n\n```js\n/**\n * Output the given `str` to _stdout_\n * or the stream specified by `options`.\n * \n * Options:\n * \n *   - `stream` defaulting to _stdout_\n * \n * Examples:\n * \n *     mymodule.write('foo')\n *     mymodule.write('foo', { stream: process.stderr })\n * \n */\n\nexports.write = function(str, options) {\n  options = options || {};\n  (options.stream || process.stdout).write(str);\n};\n```\n\nyields:\n\n```js\ndescription: \n     { full: '<p>Output the given <code>str</code> to <em>stdout</em><br />or the stream specified by <code>options</code>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Options</h2>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>stream</code> defaulting to <em>stdout</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Examples</h2>\\n\\n<pre><code>mymodule.write(\\'foo\\')\\nmymodule.write(\\'foo\\', { stream: process.stderr })\\n</code></pre>',\n       summary: '<p>Output the given <code>str</code> to <em>stdout</em><br />or the stream specified by <code>options</code>.</p>',\n       body: '<h2>Options</h2>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>stream</code> defaulting to <em>stdout</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Examples</h2>\\n\\n<pre><code>mymodule.write(\\'foo\\')\\nmymodule.write(\\'foo\\', { stream: process.stderr })\\n</code></pre>' }\n```\n\n### Tags\n\n  Dox also supports JSdoc-style tags. Currently only __@api__ is special-cased, providing the `comment.isPrivate` boolean so you may omit \"private\" utilities etc.\n\n```js\n\n/**\n * Output the given `str` to _stdout_\n * or the stream specified by `options`.\n * \n * @param {String} str\n * @param {Object} options\n * @return {Object} exports for chaining\n */\n\nexports.write = function(str, options) {\n  options = options || {};\n  (options.stream || process.stdout).write(str);\n  return this;\n};\n```\n\nyields:\n\n```js\ntags: \n   [ { type: 'param',\n       types: [ 'String' ],\n       name: 'str',\n       description: '' },\n     { type: 'param',\n       types: [ 'Object' ],\n       name: 'options',\n       description: '' },\n     { type: 'return',\n       types: [ 'Object' ],\n       description: 'exports for chaining' },\n     { type: 'api',\n       visibility: 'public' } ]\n```\n\n### Code\n\n The `.code` property is the code following the comment block, in our previous examples:\n\n```js\nexports.write = function(str, options) {\n  options = options || {};\n  (options.stream || process.stdout).write(str);\n  return this;\n};\n```\n\n### Ctx\n\n  The `.ctx` object indicates the context of the code block, is it a method, a function, a variable etc. Below are some examples:\n\n```js\nexports.write = function(str, options) {\n};\n```\n\nyields:\n\n```js\nctx: \n { type: 'method',\n   receiver: 'exports',\n   name: 'write',\n   string: 'exports.write()' } }\n```\n\n```js\nvar foo = 'bar';\n```\n\nyields:\n\n```js\nctx: \n { type: 'declaration',\n   name: 'foo',\n   value: '\\'bar\\'',\n   string: 'foo' }\n```\n\n```js\nfunction User() {\n  \n}\n```\n\nyields:\n\n```js\nctx: \n { type: 'function',\n   name: 'User',\n   string: 'User()' } }\n```\n\n### Ignore\n\nComments and their associated bodies of code may be flagged with \"!\" to be considered worth ignoring, these are typically things like file comments containing copyright etc, however you of course can output them in your templates if you want.\n\n```\n/**\n * Not ignored.\n */\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\n/*!\n * Ignored.\n */\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\n Install dev dependencies and execute `make test`:\n \n     $ npm install -d\n     $ make test\n\n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

For more information check out the very information Wikipedia article\non [Futures and Promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).\n\n## About version 0.2.x\n\nVersion 0.2.x and the master branch represent a shift in oath's core fucus. Instead of providing helper\nfunctions for manipulating the result set and deep chaining, this version allows you to manipulate the\nresult set directly, and provides helpers if this is to be done asyncronously. Docs coming shortly.\n\n## Installation\n\nOath is available for both server-side and the browser.\n\n### Node.js\n\nPackage is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install oath\n\n### Browser\n\nDownload the package and include either the normal or minimized build in your HTML header.\n\n    <script src=\"/public/js/oath.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/public/js/oath.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n## Help, resources, and issues?\n\n* The annotated source / full API documentation for versions 0.1.x is available at [alogicalparadox.com/oath](http://alogicalparadox.com/oath/).\n* If you have questions or issues, please use this projects [Github Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/oath/issues).\n\n## Contributors\n\nInterested in contributing?

    "licenseText": "[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/einaros/ws.png)](http://travis-ci.org/einaros/ws)\n\n# ws: a node.js websocket library #\n\n`ws` is a simple to use websocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455, and [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js](http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs).\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://einaros.github.com/ws for the full reports.\n\nComes with a command line utility, `wscat`, which can either act as a server (--listen), or client (--connect); Use it to debug simple websocket services.\n\n## Protocol support ##\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera. Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`, or argument `-p 8` for wscat)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`, or argument `-p 13` for wscat)\n\n_See the echo.websocket.org example below for how to use the `protocolVersion` option._\n\n## Usage ##\n\n### Installing ###\n\n`npm install ws`\n\n### Sending and receiving text data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    ws.send('something');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received\n    // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\nws.on('open', function() {\n    var array = new Float32Array(5);\n    for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) array[i] = i / 2;\n    ws.send(array, {binary: true, mask: true});\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be masked according to the websocket protocol. The same option applies for text data.\n\n### Server example ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\nwss.on('connection', function(ws) {\n    ws.on('message', function(message) {\n        console.log('received: %s', message);\n    });\n    ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({port: 8080});\n  \nwss.broadcast = function(data) {\n\tfor(var i in this.clients)\n\t\tthis.clients[i].send(data);\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices ###\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional callback.\n// The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function(error) {\n    // if error is null, the send has been completed,\n    // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note**\n// that since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not*\n// be captured when this technique is used.\ntry {\n    ws.send('something');\n}\ncatch (e) {\n    // handle error\n}\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo ###\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {protocolVersion: 8, origin: 'http://websocket.org'});\nws.on('open', function() {\n    console.log('connected');\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\nws.on('close', function() {\n    console.log('disconnected');\n});\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n    console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n    }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### wscat against echo.websocket.org ###\n\n    $ npm install -g ws\n    $ wscat -c ws://echo.websocket.org \n    connected (press CTRL+C to quit)\n    > hi there\n    < hi there\n    > are you a happy parrot?\n    < are you a happy parrot?\n\n### Other examples ###\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the examples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express 2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests ###\n\n`make test`\n\n## API Docs ##\n\nSee the doc/ directory for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## License ##\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",
